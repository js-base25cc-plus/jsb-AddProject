| Feature                            | GitHub API Support                         |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 List org/repos contributors | [`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contributors`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#list-repository-contributors) |
| 📂 PR Tracking                     | [`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls) |
| 🧵 Issue Tracking                  | [`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues) |
| 📊 User contribution stats         | [`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/stats/contributors`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/metrics/statistics#get-contributors-commit-activity) |
| 📃 Repo metadata                  | [`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#get-a-repository) |
